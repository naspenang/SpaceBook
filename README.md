# 🟦 SpaceBook  
### Your Library Room Booking Buddy

SpaceBook is an online booking system that helps library users reserve study rooms, discussion areas, media rooms, and other shared spaces. It removes the awkward walk-to-the-counter routine and replaces it with a clean online flow.

Students, lecturers, librarians, admins, and the bank unit each get their own view inside the system. It’s built to make booking less annoying and library work easier to handle.
